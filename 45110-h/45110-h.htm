<span class="sc">Eugene A. Smith</span>, and westward to Lake Superior, Wisconsin, and Arkansas.
Also in Utah, California, Oregon, British Columbia, the islands of
Alaska, Kamtschatka, Japan, Mantchooria, and the Himalayan provinces of
India. Ruprecht speaks of specimens from Newfoundland, and Professor
Gray informs me that it exists in De La Pylaie&rsquo;s collection from that island.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Description.</span>&mdash;The root-stock is elongated and creeping. It
is about the diameter of a goose-quill, is covered with minute ovate
scales, roots copiously from beneath and along the sides, and
produces fronds from the right and left sides alternately. The
stalks are usually from a foot to fifteen inches high, and from
half a line to a line in thickness. When very young, they bear
a few scattered narrow scales; but these soon fall off, leaving
<span class="pb" id="Page_013">[013]</span>
minute pointed scars. The mature stalk is roundish in section,
the convexity being greatest on the side which corresponds to the
under surface of the frond. The two convexities, anterior and
posterior, are separated by two obscure angles or ridges, which
extend the whole length of the stalk. The anterior, or flatter,
convex surface is nearly black, while the other side is a dark purplish
brown. The fibro-vascular bundle is U-shaped near the
base of the stalk; but higher up it is more like a broad, open V;
and just below the forking of the stalk it separates into two portions.
The two branches of the stalk diverge at an angle of
about fifty degrees, and rise obliquely, gracefully recurving till
they nearly meet again. From the outer side of the curve each
branch sends out from two to seven slender diverging branchlets,
which are the rachises of the pinn&aelig;. The branchlets nearest the
forking of the stalk are from four to fifteen inches long, those
more remote successively shorter. Thus the whole frond is from
five or six to fifteen or eighteen inches broad, and, while somewhat
funnel-form in the centre, radiates nearly horizontally towards
the circumference. A pressed specimen can give but little idea
of its graceful position.</p>
<p>The pinnules, or leaflets, are from six to twelve lines long, and
three or four broad, and are placed alternately on the rachises of
the pinn&aelig;. They are very numerous, seldom fewer than twelve
on each side of one of the middle (or lower) rachises, and in large
fronds sometimes as many as forty on each side. The outer
rachises bear fewer and fewer pinnules, and the outermost of even
a very large frond will not have more than eight or ten on each
<span class="pb" id="Page_014">[014]</span>
side. They are attached to the rachis by a very short and slender
stalk. Their usual form is dimidiate-oblong; that is, they appear
as if cut in two longitudinally, and the lower half removed, so
that the lower edge is entire, and straight, or often slightly hollowed;
the base, or edge nearest the rachis, is also straight and
entire; it is parallel with the rachis, or even overlaps it a little;
the upper edge is more or less lobed or incised, but in general
nearly parallel with the lower, and the end is rounded and slightly
lobed. The point of attachment is, of course, at the angle between
the lower and basal edges. The terminal pinnule of each pinna,
and the basal one, which, indeed, very often proceeds from one
of the recurved branches <i>just below</i> the origin of the pinna, are
broadly cuneate or transversely oblong in shape, the two sides
which meet at the point of attachment being equal; and the few
pinnules near the basal one are shorter and more triangular than
the middle ones. The texture is delicately membranaceous, but
elastic; the color is a lively green, and both surfaces are very
smooth. The upper surface appears to be destitute of stomata;
and this may be the reason why water will not adhere to the pinnules,
but either falls off, or stands in spheroids ready to fall. The
veins are free: in the symmetrical basal and apical pinnules the
veinlets fork repeatedly from the very base; but in the oblong
middle pinnules there is a faint principal vein running close to the
lower edge; and from this the veinlets diverge obliquely, and fork
about three times before reaching the superior margin. The incisions
of the superior margin are usually very narrow, and extend
only to about one-third of the breadth of the pinnule; but in some
<span class="pb" id="Page_015">[015]</span>
specimens from California and Oregon they are wider and considerably
deeper. The lobes are from four to six or seven in number:
in sterile fronds they are minutely toothed at the end; but
in the commoner fertile fronds they are reflexed and changed in
character, so as to form somewhat crescent-shaped or transversely
elongated involucres of a pale-brownish color. The tips of the
veinlets extend into these involucres, and bear the sporangia on
the under or inner surface. In this peculiarity is the essential
generic character of <i>Adiantum</i>. The spores of this species are
spheroid-tetrahedral, the three radiating angles marked with slender
vitt&aelig;, or bands. They are mature in the latter part of summer;
but the fronds remain until frost, often changing from green to
variegated shades of brown.</p>
<p>There do not seem to be any well-marked variations in this
fern. Ruprecht has a &ldquo;var. <i>Aleuticum</i>,&rdquo; the <i>Ad. boreale</i> of Presl,
separated mainly on account of its smaller size and fewer parts.</p>
<p>The genus <i>Adiantum</i> contains eighty-three species, according
to Mr. Baker&rsquo;s estimate; but this number is reduced to sixty-seven
by the more recent and very careful recension of Keyserling.
The species vary in form from a simple and reniform frond
an inch or two in diameter to others with ample tripinnate and
even quadripinnate fronds. The species with distinctly bipartite
and radiated fronds are <i>Ad. patens</i>, <i>hispidulum</i>, and <i>fiabellulatum</i>.
<i>A. patens</i> is found in Mexico and Central America. It is
a smaller plant than <i>A. pedatum</i>, and has deeply-sunken reniform
involucres. The other two occur in South-eastern Asia, the <i>hispidulum</i>
extending to Africa and to New Zealand, and the <i>flabellulatum</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_016">[016]</span>
to Japan: the former has hispid surfaces and small
roundish involucres; and the latter has rusty-fibrillose rachises,
coriaceous pinnules, and transversely oblong sub-confluent involucres.
<i>Ad. patens</i> follows the form and branching of our fern
very closely; but the two Old-World species often depart from it,
and show a tendency to develop branches on one or other of the
longest pinn&aelig;, thus indicating an approach towards a pyramidal
structure of the frond.</p>
<p>The remaining <i>Adianta</i> of the United States are <i>Ad. Capillus-Veneris</i>
(Linn&aelig;us), found from North Carolina to California;
<i>Ad. emarginatum</i> (Hooker), which is the <i>Ad. Chilense</i> of
American botanists, but not of Kaulfuss, found in California and
Oregon; and <i>Ad. tricholepis</i> (F&eacute;e), which occurs in Texas and
California, and extends southwards to Central America.</p>
<p>The American Maiden-hair is easily cultivated, and will grow
very freely either in a shaded corner of a garden or in the house,
and is perhaps more elegant and graceful than any other of our
ferns, the climbing-fern scarcely excepted. Josselyn evidently
mistook it for the Venus-hair, one of the chief ingredients in a
syrup which was formerly a famous remedy for nearly all ailments,
and said, &ldquo;The Apothecaries for shame now will substitute
<i>Wall-Rue</i> no more for Maiden Hair, since it grows in abundance
in <i>New-England</i>, from whence they may have good store.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="bq">Mr. Emerton&rsquo;s figure is taken from a living plant, and shows the frond
as it appears before it has been flattened in a collector&rsquo;s portfolio.</p>

Brunswick, and southward to Pennsylvania and Illinois. Mentioned by
<span class="sc">Alexander Braun</span> as coming from Arkansas. From Lapland to Sicily,
and eastward to the Amoor region, Sachalin and Kamtschatka. Not
known in the western parts of either Europe or America.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Description</span>:&mdash;The ostrich-fern is one of our finest ferns,
being surpassed in grandeur only by <i>Acrostichum aureum</i>,
<i>Woodwardia radicans</i>, and perhaps <i>Osmunda regalis</i>. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_023">[023]</span>
plant is propagated chiefly by long and slender stolons, bearing
appressed rudimentary stalk-bases. These stolons are
said by Sachs to originate from buds formed on the stalks
near the base: they run underground for several inches or a
foot, and at the end rise to the surface and there thicken into
a short erect caudex, covered by imbricating stalk-bases, and
throwing up from the apex a grand vase-like circle of foliage,
which is often higher than a man&rsquo;s head, and sometimes extends
above his utmost reach.</p>
<p>The stalks are seldom over a foot long: they are flattened,
blackish, and chaffy at the base, but above ground
they are green, drying dull-brown, somewhat four-sided, and
deeply channelled in front, when dried furrowed on the sides
also. They contain two flattened fibro-vascular bundles. The
stalks of the sterile fronds are rather longer than the others,
but more rigid, and remain erect till the second year.</p>
<p>The sterile fronds are oblong-lanceolate in outline, gradually
narrowed to the base from near the middle and abruptly
short acuminate. The pinn&aelig; are usually of nearly equal
breadth from the base to beyond the middle. They are pinnatifid
to within a line of the midrib into numerous oblong
and obtuse segments, the veins of which are free, simple and
pinnately arranged on a midvein.</p>
<p>The fertile fronds are produced late in the summer, and
are contracted, much shorter than the others, and very rigid.
The pinn&aelig; are sometimes nearly entire, and in other examples
pinnately lobed. The margins are very much recurved,
<span class="pb" id="Page_024">[024]</span>
so that the pinn&aelig; are pod-like, and either sub-cylindrical or
somewhat moniliform. The venation is free, and the sori are
dorsal on the veins. Mr. Faxon writes: &ldquo;The indusium can
be detected only when the fertile frond is very young, and
appears as a very delicate, lacerate membrane, attached at the
base of the receptacle, and serving to separate the sorus from
its neighbors. I have not found it in any case hood-like as
in <i>O. sensibilis</i>. The sori are quickly confluent, and all trace
of the indusium is soon lost. The membranaceous edge of
the transformed fertile pinna is attached near the bases of the
inferior sori and a fold is usually found pressed against the
sori as seen in the drawing (Fig. 3). This is usually ruptured,
so as to leave a portion attached at the base of the sorus,
and must not be mistaken for the true indusium, which is
within.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sporangia have twenty-six or twenty-eight articulations
of the ring. The spores are dark-colored and ovoid.</p>
<p>Imperfectly fertile fronds are often found, which are analogous
to the &ldquo;<i>obtusilobata</i>&rdquo; condition of <i>O. sensibilis</i>.</p>

Columbia, <span class="sc">Lyall</span>. In the Alps and the mountains of Northern Europe;
also in the Caucasus, and in Asia Minor.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Description.</span>&mdash;The root-stock is rather short, but branching,
and seems to form great entangled masses. The fronds
stand in a crown or circle, rising from the end of the root-stock,
which is made thick and heavy with the chaffy bases
of former stalks. Mr. Lemmon writes thus: &ldquo;It grows in a
limited locality, so far as I know, near the summit of Mount
Rose, near Webber Lake, and say at an elevation of 7,000 feet;
lat. 39&frac12;&deg; N. Fronds collected into a large mass four feet across,
short at the circumference, in the centre three feet high; most of
them fertile, and densely so, as in the specimen sent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stalks are usually but a few (four to six) inches long,
and in the dried specimens of a brownish straw-color, becoming
nearly black at the base. They bear a few large ferruginous
chaffy scales, and are deeply channelled and furrowed. The
fibro-vascular system of the stalk is altered by contraction in
drying, but apparently agrees with Dr. Milde&rsquo;s description of
<i>Athyrium</i>: &ldquo;There are two oblong peripheric bundles in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_031">[031]</span>
<i>base</i> of the stalk, which, at the base of the lamina, are united
into one of a horse-shoe shape by an arc parallel to the back of
the stalk.&rdquo; In the middle of a stalk from one of the California
specimens I find two systems of ducts, one on each side of the
stalk, and the two united by a curved and contorted border of
firm blackish tissue (sclerenchyma).</p>
<p>The fronds are from one to two feet long, and from three
to six inches wide. In general shape they are oblong-lanceolate,
acuminate, and slightly narrowed at the base. The texture is
softly membranaceous, and both surfaces are smooth. The
primary pinn&aelig; are numerous, the lower ones gradually farther
apart: their shape is lanceolate from a broad base. They are
usually twice pinnatifid, the pinnules being connected by a very
narrow foliaceous border along the midribs. The ultimate segments
are sharply toothed. The fruit-dots are very abundant,
and usually are found on all the pinn&aelig;. They are placed on
the back of the free veinlets, and are apparently devoid of indusium;
though Dr. Mettenius has discovered on young fronds an
exceedingly delicate and fugitive indusium, resembling in some
degree that of <i>Asplenium &sect; Athyrium</i>. Accordingly, in his later
work, he referred the species to the genus <i>Asplenium</i>, placing it
next to <i>A. Filix-f&oelig;mina</i>. Milde, in his work on the ferns of
Europe and Atlantis, sought to re-establish <span class="sc">Athyrium</span> as a
genus, and placed this fern in it, saying &ldquo;sori ... rotundi,
primum breviter oblongi indusio fugaci minutissimo ciliato
instructi.&rdquo; The spores are ovoid, and apparently covered with
anastomosing raised lines. Those I have examined are fuscous-brown,
but Milde says &ldquo;sub-nigr&aelig; verrucos&aelig;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_032">[032]</div>
<p>There is a European var. <i>flexilis</i>, with very narrow, nearly
sessile fronds, and the pinn&aelig; often deflexed, which has not been
observed in America.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly the greatest resemblance of this fern is to the
lady-fern, <i>Asplenium Filix-f&oelig;mina</i>; but that species has a very
well-developed indusium, while the minute objects delineated by
Mettenius scarcely deserve the name.</p>
<p>The stalks are clearly continuous with the root-stock; and
for this reason the plant is plainly not a <i>Polypodium</i>, whatever
else it may finally be determined to be.</p>

Sitka, Iliuliuk, Unalaska, Arakamtchetchene, Kotzebue Bay, Igloolik, Rittenbenk
in Greenland, and several other places, are recorded as stations for it.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Description.</span>&mdash;The root-stock is rather stout, ascending or
erect; and its apparent thickness is much increased by the persistent
bases of stalks, which also give it a dense covering of
broad bright-brown chaffy scales. The fronds, frequently to the
number of six or eight, besides old and shrivelled ones, stand in
a crown at the upper end of the root-stocks, resting on stalks
from one to four inches long, which are usually very chaffy, the
chaff continued along the rachis and midribs, though composed
of smaller scales than those lower down. The fronds are from
three or four to ten inches in length; and the greatest breadth,
just above the middle, is from one-fifth to one-sixth of the length.
<span class="pb" id="Page_035">[035]</span>
The outline is exactly lanceolate, as the apex is acute, and the
lower part gradually tapering to a somewhat narrowed base.
The fronds are delicately, but densely, bipinnate. In a frond
nine inches long there are about thirty primary pinn&aelig; on each
side, and in one of the middle pinn&aelig; about ten oblong-ovate
obtuse pinnately-incised pinnules on each side. The pinnules are
from a line to two lines long, and are adnate to the secondary
rachis by a more or less decurrent base. In large fronds the
teeth of the pinnules are again crenately toothed; but in small
specimens the pinnules themselves are entire, or but slightly
toothed. Two sterile fronds collected by Professor M. W. Harrington,
in Iliuliuk, Alaska, are broadly ovate-lanceolate in outline,
and have acute primary pinn&aelig;; and other specimens, some from
Eastern Canada, collected by Mr. Watt, and some from Northern
Wisconsin, collected by Mr. Lapham, are much slenderer and
less scaly than usual. This is the var.
<span class="greek" title="{b}">&beta;</span>
of Hooker. Usually the fronds are rather rigid, full-green above, a
little paler beneath, and both surfaces, together with the rachis,
especially the canal along the upper side of the rachis, are dotted
with very minute pellucid pale amber-colored glands. The fronds
commonly fruit very fully, even the lowest pinna bearing sporangia.
The indusia are very large, thin, orbicular, with a narrow
sinus, more or less ragged or toothed and gland-bearing at the
margin, and are so dense as to overlap each other, and nearly
conceal the back of the pinnules. The spores are ovoid, and
have a minutely verrucose or warty surface.</p>
<p>The pleasant odor of the plant remains many years in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_036">[036]</span>
herbarium. The early writers compare the fragrance to that of
raspberries, and Milde repeats the observation. Hooker and
Greville thought it &ldquo;not unlike that of the common primrose.&rdquo;
Maximowicz states that the odor is sometimes lacking. Milde
quotes Redowsky as saying that the Yakoots of Siberia use the
plant in place of tea; and, having tried the experiment myself,
I can testify to the not unpleasant and very fragrant astringency
of the infusion.</p>

Virginia and Kentucky. It is also named in local catalogues of the
flora of Wisconsin and Kansas. Not known in the Old World.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Description</span>:&mdash;The root-stock is creeping or ascending,
several inches long, and nearly an inch thick. This thickness
is made up, in considerable part, by the adherent bases of old
stalks; the stalks being perfectly continuous with the root-stock,
and so much crowded as to overlap each other. When
fresh the root-stock is fleshy, and a longitudinal section of it
shows that its substance passes so gradually into that of the
stalk-bases, that no point of separation or distinction between
the two can be selected. This kind of root-stock is found
also in <i>Aspidium spinulosum</i> and its allies, in <i>A. Filix-mas</i>,
<i>A. cristatum</i>, <i>A. marginale</i>, <i>A. Nevadense</i>, <i>A. fragrans</i>, and
<i>A. rigidum</i>, and in very many exotic species, and it is very
unlike the root-stocks of <i>A. Thelypteris</i>, <i>A. Noveboracense</i>,
and <i>A. unitum</i>, species which have been already described
and figured in the present work. The parenchymatous portion
of the root-stock is loaded with starch in very minute
grains, as may be easily proved by adding a drop of alcoholic
solution of iodine to a thin slice of the root-stock placed
<span class="pb" id="Page_043">[043]</span>
under a microscope, when the grains will be presently seen
to turn blue, the recognized sign of starch. This abundance
of nutritive material in the root-stock enables it to send up
a fine circle of large fronds in the proper season of the year.</p>
<p>The stalks are from nine to fifteen inches long, rather
stout, green when living, but straw-color when dried for the
herbarium, in which condition they are furrowed in front and
along the two sides. At the base they are covered with large
ovate-acuminate brown or sometimes dark and shining scales.
Mixed in with these are smaller and narrower chaffy scales,
which also are found along the whole length of the stalk
and the rachis. The cross-section of the stalk shows two
rather large roundish fibro-vascular bundles on the anterior
side, and three, the middle one largest, at the back.</p>
<p>Several fronds are usually seen growing from a root-stock,
those produced early in the season commonly sterile,
and shorter than the others. The full-grown and fertile fronds
are often two feet or two and a half feet long, and about
one foot broad. The general outline is oblong-ovate, the lowest
pinn&aelig; being scarcely, if at all, shorter than those in the
middle of the frond. There are usually about eight or ten
full-sized pinn&aelig; each side of the rachis, besides the gradually
diminishing pinn&aelig; near the acute pinnatifid apex. The larger
pinn&aelig; are from five to eight inches long, the middle ones an
inch or an inch and a half wide, but the lowest ones two
inches and a half broad. The greatest breadth of the pinn&aelig;
is usually near the middle or even a little above the middle,
<span class="pb" id="Page_044">[044]</span>
so that they are slightly narrowed towards the base; and in
this character lies one of the readiest distinctions between
this fern and those large forms of <i>A. cristatum</i>, which have
occasionally been mistaken for <i>A. Goldianum</i>; for in that
other species the greatest breadth of the pinn&aelig; is uniformly
at the base.</p>
<p>The segments of the pinn&aelig; are from fifteen to twenty
each side the midrib: the incisions do not extend quite to
the midrib, so that the latter is narrowly winged, and the
pinn&aelig; are pinnatifid rather than pinnate. The segments are
from nine to eighteen lines long, and about three lines wide:
they are set rather obliquely on the midrib, and are often
slightly curved upwards, or falcate. They are obtuse or
somewhat acute, and have the edges crenate, or more or less
distinctly serrate with sharp incurved teeth.</p>
<p>The veins are free, and are pinnately forked into from
three to five slender oblique veinlets, of which the lowest
one on the upper side is the longest, and bears a fruit-dot
near its base. The fruit-dots are seldom or never found on
the two or three lowest pinn&aelig;, but on the rest they are arranged
in a row each side the midveins of the segments, and
much nearer the midveins than the margins. There are in
all from ten to twenty to a segment.</p>
<p>The indusia are larger than in most of the related species,
flat, perfectly smooth, orbicular with a very narrow sinus,
and slightly erose-crenulate on the margin. In the second
edition of Gray&rsquo;s Manual it is said that the indusium is &ldquo;often
<span class="pb" id="Page_045">[045]</span>
orbicular without a distinct sinus, as in <i>Polystichum</i>;&rdquo; and
it is sometimes difficult to see the sinus, but I think it is rather
because the sides of it overlap than because there is none.
The sporangia have a ring of from fifteen to twenty articulations.
The spores are ovoid, and somewhat roughened on
the surface.</p>
<p>This fern is one of the very finest and largest of the
species of the Eastern States, being surpassed in these respects
only by the osmundas and the ostrich-fern. The fronds
are smooth, deep-green in color, slightly paler beneath, and of
a rather firm papery texture. Unlike <i>A. Filix-mas</i> and <i>A.
cristatum</i> the fronds wither in the fall of the year, and are
not &ldquo;half-evergreen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was collected by Pursh on his visit to America in the
early part of this century, the precise locality not known,&mdash;in
the Flora he says &ldquo;New Jersey to Virginia,&rdquo;&mdash;and was by
him referred to <i>A. Filix-mas</i>. His specimens, preserved in
the herbarium at Kew, are partly <i>A. Goldianum</i> and partly
<i>A. cristatum</i>. Mr. John Goldie&rsquo;s discovery was made near
Montreal, about the year 1818, and the excellent figure in
Hooker &amp; Greville&rsquo;s Icones Filicum was probably taken from
one of his specimens, or perhaps from live plants originally
brought by him to the Botanic Garden at Glasgow.</p>
<p>Though not one of our commonest Ferns, this is very
abundant in certain localities:&mdash;Mrs. Roy sends it from Owen
Sound, Canada; Dr. Bumstead got it in Smuggler&rsquo;s Notch,
Mt. Mansfield, Vermont; Mr. Frost has a fine station on Mt.
<span class="pb" id="Page_046">[046]</span>
Wantastiquet, New Hampshire; I find it plentiful and fine in
the deep ravine called Roaring Brook, in Cheshire, Connecticut;
Professor Porter has it from Burgoon&rsquo;s Gap, in the Alleghany
Mountains of Pennsylvania; Mrs. McCall, near Madison, Ohio;
Mr. Williamson &ldquo;found it in great abundance near the Little
Rockcastle River, in Laurel County,&rdquo; Kentucky, and Mr. Curtis
has twice sent me fine specimens, with very dark scales at
the base of the stalks, from the Peaks of Otter, Virginia.</p>
<p>The name is sometimes written <i>Goldieanum</i>; I give the
name as it occurs in Goldie&rsquo;s original paper in the Edinburgh
Philosophical Journal.</p>
<p class="bq">The specimen drawn by Mr. Faxon is from Vermont, and is represented
about two-thirds of the natural size.</p>

Kunze states that it was raised [at the Leipzig garden?] from Mexican
spores, and that <span class="sc">Rugel</span> collected a few specimens in North Carolina;
but Fournier rejects it as a Mexican species.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Description</span>:&mdash;This is decidedly the largest plant among
all our North American species of Cheilanthes, some of the
tallest specimens measuring nearly two feet in total length.
The root-stock is short, and disposed to branch. It is thickly
clad with fine subulate chaff, many of the scales with a dark
and rigid midnerve, and others lighter-colored and without
midnerve. The plant evidently grows in dense masses. The
stalks are clustered, each root-stock sending up a large number
of them. They are rigid, wiry, terete and covered with
grayish-tawny spreading soft woolly hairs, intermixed with
a few which are broader and decidedly paleaceous, especially
<span class="pb" id="Page_053">[053]</span>
towards the base. The section is round, and shows a firm
exterior sclerenchymatous sheath, within which is a broad
circle of brownish parenchyma, and in the middle a single
fibro-vascular bundle obtusely triangular in shape, but with
the sides slightly hollowed in.</p>
<p>The fronds vary from a few inches to over a foot in
length; their general shape is ovate-lanceolate, or oblong-lanceolate;
they are in general of a grayish color from the
abundance of a fine entangled tomentum, which covers both
surfaces, though it is a little thinner and whiter on the upper
surface. The large fronds are fully tripinnate. The primary
pinn&aelig; are oblong-ovate, short-stalked, one to nearly two
inches long, and a half to three-fourths of an inch broad at
the base. They are either opposite or alternate, the lower
ones, as usual, more separated than those that are higher up
on the frond. The secondary pinn&aelig; are close-placed, oblong,
obtuse, and again pinnated into from two to five minute
rounded or rounded-obovate sessile or adnate-decurrent pinnules
on each side, besides a terminal oval pinnule which
is twice as large as the lateral ones. These ultimate pinnules
are innumerable, and it is in allusion to their very
great number in this and the allied species that the generic
name <i>Myriopteris</i> was proposed by F&eacute;e for the group.</p>
<p>The whole margin of the pinnule is recurved, and from
the edge of it is produced a very delicate whitish involucre,
the whole forming a sort of pouch, as is admirably represented
in the figure given by F&eacute;e. The sporangia have a ring
<span class="pb" id="Page_054">[054]</span>
of about twenty articulations: F&eacute;e says there are vittate or
knotted hairs growing among them. The spores are rather
large, amber-colored, globose, and delicately trivittate. According
to F&eacute;e, when placed in water they burst and dissolve into
excessively minute sporules.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that our plant is the <i>Cheilanthes
tomentosa</i> of Link. Kunze, who knew Link&rsquo;s plant perfectly
well, referred the North Carolina specimens to it; and Dr.
Mettenius, who succeeded to the care of the Leipzig garden,
favored me with specimens which are precisely the same
thing as the plant here described. But none of the Mexican
collectors seem to have found the species, and it may be
legitimately queried whether the commonly reported origin of
Link&rsquo;s specimens is the true one. The <i>Cheilanthes tomentosa</i>
of the <i>Species Filicum</i> is partly this plant, but mainly the
species next to be described.</p>

Survey. The kind of place where this fern has been collected is
not recorded, but it probably grows in the clefts of rocks along the
sides and edges of ca&ntilde;ons.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Description</span>:&mdash;This fern bears so close a resemblance
to <i>Cheilanthes tomentosa</i>, that it is not at all surprising that
there has been more or less of confusion between the two.
It would seem that when writing his account of the genus
<i>Cheilanthes</i> for the Species Filicum, Sir W. J. Hooker had,
in his collection, no examples of the North Carolina <i>C. tomentosa</i>,
and could identify it only by Link&rsquo;s rather imperfect
description and Kunze&rsquo;s remarks in Silliman&rsquo;s Journal. Having
Wright&rsquo;s specimens of the plant here described, and Gordon&rsquo;s
fern from the Rattene Mountains&mdash;a plant not yet
satisfactorily identified&mdash;he referred them to the species named
by Link; and then perceiving with his accustomed delicate
discrimination that Lindheimer&rsquo;s and Bradbury&rsquo;s plant was
distinct from Wright&rsquo;s, he gave the former the name of <i>C.
Bradburii</i>. It was not until 1860, when the Ferns for Chapman&rsquo;s
Flora were being prepared, that any one suspected that
the <i>C. Bradburii</i> was the true <i>C. tomentosa</i>. In 1866, I had
<span class="pb" id="Page_057">[057]</span>
an opportunity of explaining the matter to Mr. Baker, then
at work on the Synopsis Filicum, and not long after, I was
surprised, and I need not say pleased, by finding that he
had given to Hooker&rsquo;s <i>C. tomentosa</i> the name it now bears.</p>
<p>The root-stock is short, assurgent, and chaffy with rather
rigid slender-pointed scales, most of them furnished with a
dark midnerve. The stalks are tufted, and are perhaps a
little slenderer than those of <i>C. tomentosa</i>. They are chaffy
throughout, but more especially at the base, with narrow pale
ferruginous scales, intermixed with still slenderer paleaceous
hairs. The section is slightly flattened on the anterior side.
The exterior sheath is firm; inside of it is brownish parenchyma,
and in the middle a semicircular fibro-vascular bundle,
the ducts in the centre of it arranged in a figure much like
a letter X.</p>
<p>The fronds are considerably smaller than in <i>C. tomentosa</i>.
They are similarly oblong-lanceolate and tripinnate, the ultimate
pinnules being very numerous and rather more closely
crowded than in the other species just referred to. The
pubescence is harsher and not so webby on the upper side,
and is decidedly heavier and more matted on the under surface.
The scales of the branches, or secondary rachises, are
broader and shorter than those of the stalk and are very
conspicuous in young fronds. In older fronds they fall away,
to some extent, and are then less abundant.</p>
<p>The pinnules are rather rounder and less oval than in
<i>C. tomentosa</i>, and though they are somewhat purse-shaped,
<span class="pb" id="Page_058">[058]</span>
the involucre consists almost entirely of the recurved herbaceous
margin, the proper whitish and delicately membranous
involucre being nearly suppressed.</p>
<p>The spores are sub-globose, amber-colored, faintly trivittate,
and have a finely pustulated or granular surface.</p>
<p>In respect to the narrow herbaceous involucre this fern
comes nearest to <i>Cheilanthes lanuginosa</i>, of Nuttall, figured
in &ldquo;Ferns of North America.&rdquo; It has, however, much larger
fronds; and the copious, though narrow scales of the stalk,
as well as the scales of the rachises, will readily distinguish it.</p>
<p>It is among the Ferns which have been cultivated by
Hon. J. Warren Merrill, though I am not informed what are
its special needs in the way of soil, moisture, etc.</p>

<p class="bq"><span class="sc">Hab.</span>&mdash;In one form or another, this species occurs in America from
Greenland to Peru, throughout Europe and Asia, in parts of Africa, and
in many islands of the ocean. The ordinary European form corresponding
to Moore&rsquo;s plate XIV has been collected in British Columbia by
Dr. <span class="sc">Lyall</span>, in Keweenaw Peninsula of Northern Michigan by Dr. <span class="sc">Robbins</span>,
and in the mountains of Colorado by Messrs. <span class="sc">Hall &amp; Harbour</span> and
Mr. <span class="sc">Brandegee</span>. Var. <i>incisum</i> was found at the base of calcareous rocks
at Royston Park, Owen Sound, Ontario, Canada, by Mrs. <span class="sc">Roy</span>, and in
the mountains of Colorado by Dr. <span class="sc">Scovill</span>, for one of whose specimens
I am indebted to <span class="sc">D. A. Watt</span>, Esq., of Montreal. Fragments of apparently
the same form have been received from Dakota. The Californian
plant mentioned in Plant&aelig; Hartwegian&aelig;, p. 342, is better regarded
as a form of <i>Aspidium rigidum</i>. Var. <i>paleaceum</i> has not been found in
either Canada or the United States, but is well known in Mexico, in
Europe, in Southern Asia, in the Hawaiian Islands, etc.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Description</span>:&mdash;This fern has a stout, usually ascending,
but sometimes erect, very chaffy root-stock, very much like
<span class="pb" id="Page_066">[066]</span>
that of the species last described. It sometimes rises a little
above the surface of the ground, forming a short trunk.</p>
<p>The stalks seem to vary a good deal in length, being
sometimes only two or three inches long, and at other times
over a foot. They are clustered at the growing end of the
root-stock, and their bases, which remain long after the rest
has perished, are consolidated with the root-stock. The stalks
are always more or less chaffy, the chaff mainly confined to
the lowest portion in some plants, and in others following the
stalk and the rachis to the apex of the frond. The largest
scales are sometimes fully an inch long. They are narrowly
lanceolate-acuminate, distantly ciliate-denticulate on the margin,
and composed of narrow but somewhat sinuous cells. Mixed
in with them are smaller scales, from two to four lines long,
and more distinctly ciliate-toothed. The color of the scales
is different in different specimens, varying from bright golden-brown
to ferruginous-brown with a darker spot at the base,
and from this to nearly black, especially in the sub-tropical
and tropical forms of var. <i>paleaceum</i>. Such specimens are
sometimes fairly shaggy with the abundance of scales, which
are also found, decreasing in number and in size, on the
midribs of the pinn&aelig;, and even on the lower surface of the
segments. The usual number of fibro-vascular bundles is
seven.</p>
<p>The fronds are broadly lanceolate or oblong-lanceolate in
outline, usually narrowed a little, or even conspicuously narrowed,
at the base, and acute or acuminate at the apex. They
<span class="pb" id="Page_067">[067]</span>
are of a full herbaceous green above, a little paler beneath,
and of a rather firmly membranaceous, or, in tropical forms,
of a sub-coriaceous texture. Their average length is from
one to two feet, but fronds three feet long are occasionally
seen; and one very fine example of var. <i>paleaceum</i>, collected
in Chiapas, Mexico, by Dr. Ghiesbreght, is three feet and a
half long, exclusive of the stalk.</p>
<p>The pinn&aelig; are sometimes very numerous; as many as
forty on each side have been counted on very large fronds,
but the number is more commonly less than twenty. They
are lanceolate-acuminate in shape, tapering from a broad base
to a slender point; in the common form their average
breadth at the base is half to three-fourths of an inch, but in
var. <i>incisum</i> they are often fully two inches broad at the base.
Their length is from three or four inches in the common
form to six or seven inches in the largest specimens I have
seen. The midrib of the pinn&aelig; is always more or less winged,
so that the pinn&aelig; may be said to be pinnatifid, and the segments
to be connected by a narrow wing.</p>
<p>The shape of the segments differs in the several varieties;
in the type they are very close together, oblong, with a
rounded apex, and not very deeply toothed: in var. <i>paleaceum</i>
they are also closely-placed, and oblong, but mostly truncate
at the apex; and in var. <i>incisum</i> they are much larger and
less closely-placed, ovate-lanceolate in shape, and incised with
toothed lobes along the sides.</p>
<p>The veins are free, and are forked or alternately divided
<span class="pb" id="Page_068">[068]</span>
into from two to five veinlets. The sori are rather large,
placed nearer the midvein than the margin, and are rarely
produced towards the apex of the segments.</p>
<p>The indusium is orbicular-reniform, and almost always
smooth. Its edges are turned downward, enclosing the sporangia,
when they are young, and sometimes this convexity is
permanent. Rarely the sinus is so deep that the indusium
at last becomes divided. The spores are ovoid, and have a
muricately roughened surface.</p>
<p>The rhizomes have been used for ages as an anthelmintic,
but probably have no greater virtue in this direction
than those of many other common species.</p>

common Mexican species; it is found as far South as Peru, and reap

<p><span class="sc">Description</span>:&mdash;This belongs to the same group of species
as <i>P. Wrightiana</i>, <i>brachyptera</i> and <i>Ornithopus</i>. It has
the same nodose and scaly root-stock, dark and polished stalk,
glaucescent frond and mucronulate pinnules. In Mexico,
South America and the Hawaiian Islands it never occurs
with more than trifoliolate pinnules, and this is perhaps the
best reason for considering <i>P. Wrightiana</i> a distinct species.
The pinn&aelig; are tripartite rather than trifoliolate, while in the
other fern just referred to, when trifoliolate the odd pinnule
is more distinct and usually stalked, a distinction indicated
by Hooker, but for which I am more indebted to the accurate
discrimination of Mr. Faxon. In more southern localities
the fronds are considerably larger than Dr. Hayes&rsquo; specimens,
and the segments of the pinn&aelig; ampler. In very dry seasons
the pinn&aelig; are considerably deflexed. The spores are trivittate

<p class="bq"><span class="sc">Hab.</span>&mdash;Crevices of shaded calcareous rocks; from Canada to the
Rocky Mountains of British America, and southward to Alabama, Arkansas,
Indian Territory and Arizona. It has been found in several
parts of Mexico, and even in South America (&ldquo;Andes of Mecoya,
<span class="sc">Pearce</span>,&rdquo; according to <i>Synopsis Filicum</i>). It was collected by <span class="sc">John
Clayton</span> about 1736, &ldquo;on the shore of the river Rappahannock in a
shady place by the root of a juniper near the promontory called Point
Lookout,&rdquo; and I take pleasure in giving it an English name in his
honor.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Description</span>:&mdash;The root-stock of this fern is rather
short, usually somewhat nodose, and densely chaffy with very
<span class="pb" id="Page_077">[077]</span>
narrow long-pointed soft bright-brown scales, which in the
specimens examined are destitute of midnerve.</p>
<p>The stalks are rigid and wiry, terete, nearly black in
color, but with a slight reddish tinge, and usually more or
less pubescent with very narrow chaffy hairs, which are often
more abundant and harsher along the rachises, making them
almost hirsute. <i>Pell&aelig;a glabella</i> was founded on specimens
from Missouri and the North-West, which had the stalk
perfectly smooth, and the chaff of the root-stock a trifle
wider than usual. The section of the stalk shows a single
U-shaped fibro-vascular bundle, and a strong outer sclerenchymatous
sheath.</p>
<p>The fronds are developed late in the Spring, and remain
green through the next Winter. They are almost coriaceous
in texture, smooth and dark-bluish-green above, paler, and
sometimes slightly chaffy beneath. They are from a few
inches to about a foot in length, and vary in outline from
ovate to oblong-lanceolate. In seedling plants the earliest
fronds are round-cordate, the next cordate-ovate, and then follow
trifoliate, pinnate, and finally mature bipinnate fronds.
The largest fronds have about five pairs of compound pinn&aelig;,
each with from three to eleven pinnules, and above these are
from four to six pairs of simple pinn&aelig;, besides the terminal
one, which is often the longest of all.</p>
<p>The pinnules and the simple pinn&aelig; of the sterile fronds
are commonly oval, and not more than half an inch long,
but those of the fertile fronds are narrower and longer, sometimes
<span class="pb" id="Page_078">[078]</span>
nearly two inches long. The base is either truncate or
slightly cordate; sometimes where there is a transition from
compound to simple pinn&aelig;, a pinna will be found conspicuously
auricled on both sides, or on the upper side only.
Forked pinnules are occasionally seen.</p>
<p>The margin is continuously recurved to form a rather
broad involucre, and the very edge is somewhat thinner and
whiter. The veins are pinnately arranged on both sides of
the midvein, and fork about twice before reaching the margin.
The upper part of the veinlets is covered with sporangia,
which as they ripen push out from beneath the
involucre. The spores are obscurely tetrahedral and trivittate,
as in the other species of the genus.</p>
<p>This fern very often grows in company with <i>Camptosorus
rhizophyllus</i>, and its root-stock is often hidden beneath mosses
of the genus <i>Anomodon</i>: it takes kindly to cultivation,
especially if it be planted in the crevices of calcareous rock-work.
It may occur on other than calcareous rock, but I
have never seen it on either granite, sandstone or basalt.</p>
<p>Names for varieties of this species have been proposed
by Pursh, and by Fournier, but the characters assigned do
not seem sufficiently distinctive.</p>

is found in Sunderland, Massachusetts; at Trenton Falls, Chittenango
Falls, and other deep glens in Central New York; in Lycoming and
Sullivan Counties, Pennsylvania, and in other similar places in Vermont,
Michigan, etc., but is by no means a common plant.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Description</span>:&mdash;This is the most delicate of all the
<i>Pell&aelig;as</i>, and has fronds a good deal like those of <i>Cryptogramme
acrostichoides</i>, but tenderer, and with sub-marginal
fructification. The root-stock is very slender, scarcely more
than half a line in thickness, and sometimes two or three
inches long. It is so hidden in the crevices of the rocks
that it is seldom secured by collectors. The scales are minute,
appressed to the root-stock, and almost filmy in their
delicacy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_081">[081]</div>
<p>The stalks are scattered along the root-stock, and are
generally about five or six inches long, those of the fertile
fronds longer, stouter and of a darker color than the others.
They are smooth and somewhat polished, but lighter in color
and far more tender in consistency than in most of our other
species of this genus.</p>
<p>The fertile and the sterile fronds are unlike, though both
are very delicately membranaceous, and pinnate with once or
twice pinnatifid pinn&aelig;. The rachis is not winged in its lower
half, except in very small fronds, but above the middle it is
narrowly winged, as are also its divisions. The lowest one
or two pairs of pinn&aelig; are twice pinnatifid in the largest
specimens, but more commonly but once pinnatifid. In the
sterile fronds the segments of the pinn&aelig; are very plainly
adnate to the secondary midrib, and are roundish or roundish-obovate
in shape. They are from three to six lines long and
about two-thirds as broad. Their margin is more or less
lobed and crenately toothed. In the fertile fronds the segments
are more distinct, longer and narrower, measuring often
six to ten lines in length and one or two in width. The terminal
pinna of the frond and the terminal segments of the
pinn&aelig; are considerably longer than the others. The veins
are conspicuous, and distant, much more so than in our
other species of <i>Pell&aelig;a</i>. They fork once about midway between
the midvein and the margin, and sometimes, especially
in fertile fronds, a second time just within the margin.</p>
<p>The involucre is continuous, broad, and even more delicate
<span class="pb" id="Page_082">[082]</span>
than the frond itself. The sporangia are comparatively
scanty, and are fully covered by the involucre. The spores
are spheroid-tetrahedral and obscurely trivittate.</p>
<p>Mr. Moore and some other authors are disposed to insist
on the right of priority belonging to the specific name
<i>Stelleri</i>. But the name <i>gracilis</i> has been used by nearly
every writer on American Ferns since the time of Michaux,
and will most probably be kept up rather than the other.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Ruprecht considered his <i>Allosorus
Stelleri</i> to be distinct from our plant, and mentions
several points of difference in his work on the Distribution
of Vascular Cryptogamia in the Russian Empire.</p>

and characteristic ferns, confined to North America, but extending from
New Brunswick to Central Alabama, Professor <span class="sc">Eugene A. Smith</span>;
westward to Arkansas, Professor <span class="sc">F. L. Harvey</span>; Wisconsin, <span class="sc">Parry</span>,
<span class="sc">T. J. Hale</span>; and brought from the Saskatchewan and the Rocky Mountains
of British America by <span class="sc">Drummond</span>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Description</span>:&mdash;Professor Robinson has remarked of this
species:&mdash;&ldquo;This comes nearer being a tree fern than any
other of our species; the caudex, covered by the bases of
fronds of previous seasons, sometimes resting on bare rocks
<span class="pb" id="Page_089">[089]</span>
for four or five inches without roots or fronds.&rdquo; The root-stock
is much like that of <i>A. Filix-mas</i>, being very stout-closely
covered with persistent stalk-bases and very chaffy.
The chaff really grows mainly on the bases of the stalks, or
covers the closely coiled buds which crown the root-stock. It is
composed of shining ferruginous-brown thin lanceolate acuminate
scales fully an inch in length, and destitute of a thickened
midnerve. The fronds grow in elegant crowns from the
apex of the root-stock, some six or eight or perhaps ten to
a plant. The stalks vary in length, but are seldom more than
a foot long. They are rather stout, round, but with a slight
furrow in front, commonly reddish-brown in color, fading when
dry to straw-color, and contain five or seven roundish fibro-vascular
bundles, of which the two anterior ones are largest,
and the next two the smallest.</p>
<p>The outline of the fronds is ovate-lanceolate, varying to
oblong-lanceolate. The frond is commonly not quite so wide
at the base as in the middle, though in small specimens the
base is often the widest. The texture is thicker than in any
other of our Wood-ferns, and the fronds are fairly evergreen,
not withering until the next year&rsquo;s fronds begin to uncoil.
In cutting, the fronds vary from pinnate, with pinnatifid pinn&aelig;
and short nearly entire lobes, to twice pinnate, with pinnately-lobed
segments. In the example selected for our plate the
pinnules are oblong, obtuse and crenulate, or at most, crenately-toothed.
Other, and perhaps no larger, fronds will have
most of the pinnules twice or even thrice as long as these,
<span class="pb" id="Page_090">[090]</span>
ovate-lanceolate and pointed, narrowed to a sub-cordate and
obscurely-stalked base, and deeply pinnately-lobed. This is
var. <i>elegans</i> of Professor Robinson. Professor Lawson has
a var. <i>Traill&aelig;</i>, which has &ldquo;very large bipinnate fronds, all
the pinnules pinnatifid.&rdquo; A very common form noticed by
Mr. L. M. Underwood in Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical
Club, has fronds only four or five inches long, the lower
pinn&aelig; only pinnatifid and the upper ones lobed, the sori
mostly solitary on the lobes.</p>
<p>The veins and veinlets of the frond are very distinct,
being marked by depressions in the upper surface in the living
fronds, and visible as dark lines in the dried specimens.
The veins fork near the midvein; the upper branch may be
fertile at its tip; the lower branch is either simple, or forks
a second, and perhaps a third time. All the veinlets are
curved. On account of the venation Presl referred this plant
to his section <i>Arthrobotrys</i>.</p>
<p>The sori are close to the margin of the lobes, and vary
from one to twelve to a lobe. They are very large and
prominent, and have firm lead-colored orbicular-reniform indusia,
which are slightly incurved round the edge, and depressed
at the sinus. As the fronds mature the indusia become
brownish. The spores are ovoid-reniform and have a narrow
crenulate wing.</p>

<p class="bq"><span class="sc">Hab.</span>&mdash;On mossy rocks, especially limestone. Not uncommon from
Canada to Virginia and Alabama, and westward to Wisconsin and Kansas.
It occurs in many places in Western New England, but is rare to the east.
It has lately been found a few miles from Boston; but there is a doubt
whether the station is truly natural.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Description.</span>&mdash;The walking-leaf is usually found in patches
of considerable extent. It seems to prefer mossy calcareous rocks,
and the finest specimens are usually firmly rooted in the crevices.
In Cheshire, Connecticut, it grows freely on moist cliffs of sandstone
bordering a deep ravine; and in Orange, in the same State,
it is found on scattered ledges of serpentine. The root-stock is
very short, but creeping: it bears a few dark-fuscous scales, and
is covered with the remains of decayed stalks. A few fronds
grow from the end of the root-stock, and are supported on slender
herbaceous stems a few inches long. A transverse section of the
lower part of the stalk is semicircular, and shows a very slender
triangular central thread of dark sclerenchyma, with two somewhat
roundish fibro-vascular bundles close beneath or behind it.
A section higher up shows that the stalk is there narrowly winged
on each side, and the two fibro-vascular bundles have coalesced
into one of a roundish-triangular shape. The frond is long and
narrow, and rarely rises erect, but usually is decumbent or reclined
in position.</p>
<p>The wings of the stalk widen out into a wedge-shaped base,
which is sunken in a sinus between two basal auricles of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_097">[097]</span>
frond. These auricles are scantily developed in small fronds;
but in larger ones they are more or less prominent, making the
base of the frond either cordate or hastate. In specimens from
Cheshire, Connecticut, and in some from Indiana, the auricles are
drawn out into slender points, in one instance fully four inches
long. The fronds are deep-green in color, and sub-coriaceous in
texture. The fronds of mature plants are from six to twelve, or
even fifteen, inches long; and their greatest width, measured just
above the auricles, is about one-twelfth of the length, or from six
to fifteen lines. The midrib is a little paler than the rest of the
frond, and is rather prominent on the under surface. The margin
of the frond is gently undulating or entire, rarely incised.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a>
The upper part of the frond is scarcely wider than the stalk, and
commonly produces a proliferous bud at the apex, where it very
frequently takes root, and develops a new plant. In this way a
single plant in a favorable position will become a whole colony
in a few years&rsquo; time.</p>
<p>The venation is peculiar, and the disposition of the sori
depends mainly on the peculiarities of the venation. Dr. Endlicher&rsquo;s
description of them is so clear, that it is well to repeat it
here: &ldquo;Veins anastomosing [i.e., reticulating] in two series of
hexagonal areoles [meshes], the angles of the marginal areoles
sending out free, simple or forked, veinlets. Sori linear, solitary
in the costal areoles [those nearest the midrib] and on the marginal
veinlets: the indusium of the latter free toward the margin
<span class="pb" id="Page_098">[098]</span>
of the frond; of the former, toward the costa. In the areoles of
the second series the sori are opposite: the indusium of the lower
one free toward the costa; of the other, in the opposite direction.&rdquo;
To this it may be added, that in some of the areoles the two sori
meet and are confluent at the outer angle of the areole; and in
this case the two indusia are sometimes, though not always,
united into one. The indusia of the areoles next the midrib are
also often bent at an angle, and the two portions plainly united.
It was from this condition of some of the sori that the genus was
named <i>Camptosorus</i> (bent fruit-dot); and it is only on this peculiarity
that the genus can be kept separate.</p>
<p>The indusium is thin and delicate, composed of sinuous-margined
cellules, and is more or less wavy along the free edge.
The spores are ovoid, and have a crenated pellucid wing-like
margin.</p>
<p>Sir W. J. Hooker referred the <i>Camptosorus</i>, together with
the species of <i>Antigramma</i>, and the very peculiar Mexican fern
<i>Schaffneria</i>, to the genus <i>Scolopendrium</i>; making the distinctive
character of the genus to rest on the sori being &ldquo;in pairs, opposite
to each other, one originating on the superior side of a veinlet,
the other on the inferior side of the opposite veinlet or
branch.&rdquo; In this he was essentially anticipated twenty years by
Dr. Endlicher; to whom, however, <i>Schaffneria</i> was unknown.</p>
<p>It is by no means impossible that future botanists will refer
all these species to the old Linn&aelig;an genus <i>Asplenium</i>; for it is
now pretty generally admitted that differences in venation do not
constitute valid generic distinctions, and a radicant bud on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_099">[099]</span>
frond is common in many undeniably genuine <i>Asplenia</i>: and
since <i>Diplazium</i>, with double involucres placed back to back on
the same vein, is inseparable from <i>Asplenium</i>, it is by no means
impossible that <i>Scolopendrium</i> and <i>Camptosorus</i> should be thought
to have no better claim to rank as genera.</p>
<p>Probably the earliest notice of the walking-leaf is in <span class="sc">Ray&rsquo;s</span>
&ldquo;Historia Plantarum,&rdquo; vol. ii., p. 1927, published in 1688. It is
there called &ldquo;Phyllitis parva saxatilis per summitates folii prolifera.&rdquo;
Other early accounts may be found in the &ldquo;Species
Plantarum&rdquo; of <span class="sc">Linn&aelig;us</span> and of <span class="sc">Willdenow</span>, and in the second
edition of <span class="sc">Gronovius&rsquo;s</span> &ldquo;Flora Virginica.&rdquo; In the latter work it
may be seen that Gov. Colden long ago described the auricles
as being &ldquo;also often acuminate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A second species, with membranaceous fronds acute at the
base (<span class="sc">C. Sibiricus</span>), occurs in Northern Asia, but is apparently
very rare.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Description.</span>&mdash;The root-stocks of this little fern are creeping,
branched and often entangled, and chaffy with narrow lance-acuminate
dark-fuscous scales. The cellular structure of these
scales is similar to that of the scales of <i>A. ebeneum</i>, the cells
being oblong-rectangular, and arranged in straight longitudinal
rows. The stalks are from two to four inches long, and slightly
chaffy when young: they are brown and shining at the base, but
green higher up, except that a narrow line of brown is continued
up the under side of the stalk nearly or quite to the base of the
frond. A section made near the lower extremity of the stalk is
nearly semicircular, and discloses two roundish fibro-vascular
bundles side by side near the middle, and a minute thread of
sclerenchyma, or hard dark tissue, on the inner side of each
bundle. A section just below the frond shows the two fibro-vascular
bundles united into one, and the angles of the stalk
slightly extended, forming very narrow wing-like borders. The
minute inner filaments of sclerenchyma are never continued far
up the stalk, and are sometimes wanting altogether.</p>
<p>The frond is from three to six inches long, and usually half
an inch to an inch broad at the base, from which the general outline
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
tapers to a long and slender point, not so long as the prolongation
of the walking-leaf, and very rarely, if ever, rooting at the
apex.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a>
The fronds are mostly erect, sub-coriaceous or firmly
membranaceous, smooth above, but with a few minute setulose
scales beneath, deeply pinnatifid in the lower and middle portion,
and sinuately lobed above, the long terminal portion undulate on
the margins. The midrib is broad and well defined: it is winged
throughout its length; the wing narrow at the base of the frond,
but constantly widening upwards.</p>
<p>The lobes are irregularly roundish-ovate, sinuate, crenate or
slightly toothed; the lowest ones occasionally drawn out into an
acuminate point an inch long. Most of the lobes are attached
to the wing of the midrib by a broad base: the lower ones sometimes
have a short stalk.</p>
<p>The veins are everywhere free: in the lower lobes, if these
are acuminate, the veins are pinnately branched from a mid-vein;
elsewhere they are forked or dichotomous. The sori are mostly
single, though here and there one will be diplazioid,&mdash;most commonly
the lowest one on the superior side of the lobe. The indusia
are very delicate; and the free edge is directed toward the
middle of the lobe, excepting the indusia of the sori nearest the
midrib, and these open toward the midrib. The sori are usually
very full of sporangia, and, when ripe, nearly cover the back of the
frond: even the narrow acumination bears a sorus at each undulation
of the margin. Spores ovoid-bean-shaped, with reticulating
ridges and an irregular winged border.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>This is now admitted by all pteridologists to be a distinct
species; though it was formerly confounded with the <i>Camptosorus</i>,
from which it is clearly distinguished by the free veins, the mostly
single indusia, and the usual absence of a proliferous bud at the
apex of the frond. Some of the less compound and more attenuated
forms of <i>A. montanum</i> come much nearer to it; but in its
simplest form this other species always has the fronds fairly pinnate,
and its more compound forms resemble the <i>A. pinnatifidum</i>
very little.</p>
<p>I take occasion to express my thanks to Hon. Thomas M.
Peters of Moulton, Alabama, who has sent me abundant and fine
specimens of this fern and of other rare species which are found
in the northern part of Alabama.</p>

<p class="bq"><span class="sc">Hab.</span>&mdash;Wet meadows and thickets, from New Brunswick to the Saskatchewan,
extending southward through Dacotah, Kansas, and Arkansas
to Louisiana, and eastward to St. Augustine, Florida, one of our commonest
and most abundant ferns, often occupying large portions of land
to the partial exclusion of other plants. Not found in western America
or in Europe, but occurring in Japan, Mantchooria and eastern Siberia.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Description</span>:&mdash;The root-stock is about one-third of an
inch thick, and irregularly roundish in section. It creeps
widely below the surface of the ground, rooting freely and
often forking, so that in cultivation it is very difficult to confine
the plant to one spot. The root-stock contains six or
eight roundish or flattened fibro-vascular bundles arranged in a
circle near the outer surface. It bears no chaff. The stalks
are scattered along its length, the apex being covered with the
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
thickened stalk-bases of next year&rsquo;s fronds, and the stalks for
the present year rising a few inches back of the apex.</p>
<p>The fronds are truly dimorphous, the fertile ones being so
unlike the sterile, that no one who is unacquainted with the
plant would suppose they had anything to do with each other.</p>
<p>The sterile fronds vary in length from one or two inches
to fifteen or eighteen, and are supported on stalks usually
rather longer still, so that, while the smallest plants may be
concealed in the grass, the tallest ones are often fully three
feet high. The bases of the stalks are flattened, discolored
and very sparingly chaffy; the upper part is green in the
living plant, brownish-stramineous when dried, smooth and
naked, rounded at the back, and slightly furrowed in front.
It contains two obliquely-placed strap-shaped fibro-vascular
bundles, which unite below the base of the frond and form
one having a U-shaped section. The outline of the sterile
fronds is triangular or triangular-ovate. The midrib is winged,
either from the very base, or from the second pair of segments;
the wing at its lower extremity very narrow, but gradually
widening towards the apex, so that its greatest width is but
little less than that of the terminal segment. The number
of segments in the smallest fronds is two or three on each
side; in the largest fronds twelve or thirteen on each side.
The lowest segments are rather more than half as long as
the whole frond; the next segments usually a little smaller,
but sometimes a little longer than the first pair, and the
remaining ones rapidly decreasing. The segments are broadly
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
lanceolate or oblong-lanceolate, narrowed at the base, especially
the lower ones, and either rounded or sub-acute at
the apex. The sinuses between them are rounded, and are
gradually narrowed towards the apex of the frond. The
segments are very minutely serrulate on the edges; the
smallest ones otherwise entire, and the larger ones either
with sinuous margins or, in large fronds, deeply sinuous-pinnatifid.
The texture is herbaceous, the surfaces perfectly
smooth, the color of the upper surface grass-green, of the
lower surface paler and slightly glaucescent. The fronds
wilt very soon after plucking them, and in wilting there is
a slight disposition to fold the segments together, face to
face, for which reason the plant has received the name of
&ldquo;Sensitive-Fern.&rdquo; The first frost of autumn destroys the
sterile fronds; and a late frost in May or June does the same.
The midribs are prominent, and the veins conspicuous; the
latter being copiously reticulated into areoles which enclose
no free veinlets. Along the sides of the midribs and midveins
are very long and narrow areoles, and outside of these
are obliquely-placed oblong areoles in several irregular rows.</p>
<p>The fertile fronds are not very common, and a young
botanist may search in vain for them for a long time. They
stand only about half as high as the sterile fronds, and are very
rigid. They are nearly black in color: in winter they dry up,
but remain erect through the next summer, so that a fruiting
plant often has fertile fronds standing of two years&rsquo; growth.
The frond is only a few (usually four to six) inches long,
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
and consists of from four to ten pairs of appressed fleshy or
cartilaginous pinn&aelig;, which are divided into a double row of
sub-globose bead-like segments or pinnules; the whole looking
like a small and narrow but dense cluster of diminutive grapes.
Each pinnule has its edges so much recurved that the whole
forms a sort of pouch, apparently filled with sporangia.</p>
<p>Mr. Faxon has made a careful study of the sori, and
has very kindly furnished the account given below.<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a></p>
<p>The articulations of the sporangia are said by F&eacute;e to
be twenty-eight to thirty-two, and more numerous than in any
other fern. I have counted only thirty at most, and more frequently
only twenty-eight. The spores are ovoid and very
dark-colored.</p>
<p>Var. <i>obtusilobata</i>, <span class="sc">Torrey</span>, Fl. New York, ii., p. 499, t. clx
(<i>Onoclea obtusilobata</i>, <span class="sc">Schkuhr</span>), is not a permanent variation
of the species, but is based on a not infrequent condition of
the plant, in which the pinn&aelig; of some of the foliaceous fronds
become deeply pinnatifid into obovate segments, which have
mostly free veins and imperfectly developed sori. The indusia
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
appear as little whitish scales on the back of the veins. It
occurs in almost all places where the plant is common, is
often produced from root-stocks which bear also normal fronds,
and presents all gradations from the usual sterile frond to the
proper fertile one. <i>Ragiopteris onocleoides</i> of Presl is founded
on a young fertile frond of this species placed with a sterile
one of what Milde judges to be a monstrous form of <i>Aspidium
Filix-mas</i>. Maximowicz describes a var. <i>interrupta</i>, from
the Amoor region, in which the fertile frond nearly equals the
sterile, and has elongated pinn&aelig;, with remote segments. This
condition is also sometimes seen in American specimens, and
is hardly a true variety.</p>
<p>In an article on &ldquo;The late Extinct Floras of North
America,&rdquo; which appeared in Vol. ix of the Annals of the New
York Lyceum of Natural History, in April, 1868, Professor
Newberry describes certain fossil specimens of ferns occurring
in Miocene argillaceous limestone at Fort Union, Dacotah,
and refers them with little hesitation to this species. I have
not seen the specimens, but, as similar venation and not very
dissimilar fronds are seen in Woodwardia and Pteris, one
may perhaps doubt the absolute certainty of the identification.</p>

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
